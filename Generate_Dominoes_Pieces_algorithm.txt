GenerateDominoesPieces

Parameters: qtdePieces 		=> int // number of generated pieces
Parameters: maxValuePiece 	=> int // max value each piece could receive

GenerateDominoesPieces.exe 6 12 (will be generated a file with 6 pieces and max value of each piece is 12)


Algorithm

qtde is a number equal to args[o] value
maxValue is a number equal to args[1] value
create a dictionary where key is an integer and value is a string

while qtde greater than zero
	set line as two random number (values from 0 up to maxValue) with a white space among them  (6 8 for example)
	verify if the line is in the dictionary
	if line is already in the dictionary
		initialize hasAdded as false
		while hasAdded is false
			set line as two random number (values from 0 up to maxValue) with a white space among them  (6 8 for example)
			verify if the line is in the dictionary
			if line is not in the dictionary
				add line to dictionary where qtde is the key and line is the value
				set hasAdded as true				
	else
		add line to dictionary where qtde is the key and line is the value

initialize numberPart to one;
initialize caseName as empty string.

the output file name will be 'case_xxx.txt' where xxx is the numberPart converted to string with one zero in the left ( the output file name must be "case_01.txt")
set caseName as the output file name
verify if already exists a file with this name (caseName) on the current directory
	if exists
		initialize hasFile as false;
		while hasFile is false
			add one to numberPart
			set caseName as the output file name
			verify if already exists a file with this name (caseName) on the current directory
			if not exists a file with this name (caseName) on the current directory
				create a txt file with this name (caseName) on the current directory
				add the number qtdePieces to the file created
				add all values from dictionary to the file created
				set hasFile as true
	else
		create a txt file with this name (caseName) on the current directory
		add the number qtdePieces to the file created
		add all values from dictionary to the file created

print message: the file has been created: (caseName)
